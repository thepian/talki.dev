aboutProject:
  leftCol: >
    <p>Caplin Trader was a groundbreaking browser-based financial trading platform that revolutionized how traders accessed real-time market data and executed trades. During the 2007-2014 period, browser technology was rapidly evolving, and we were pioneers in creating sophisticated financial applications that worked seamlessly across different browsers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built one of the most complex Ajax applications of its time</li>
      <li>Supported major financial institutions with white-labeled solutions</li>
      <li>Enabled real-time FX, fixed income, and multi-asset trading</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The platform required cutting-edge web technology to deliver institutional-grade trading capabilities through browsers, at a time when most financial software was desktop-based. This demanded expertise in real-time data streaming, cross-browser compatibility, and high-performance JavaScript.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cross-browser compatibility across IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari</li>
      <li>Real-time market data streaming and visualization</li>
      <li>Custom forms framework for complex trading workflows</li>
      <li>White labeling architecture for institutional branding</li>
    </ul>
