introduction: >
  <p>In preparation for an integration with internal systems, I planned and implemented the initial version of the offboarding flow. This lets supervisors, stakeholders and the employee work together to accomplish the tasks that make up the offboarding in a easy, timely and safe manner.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Backend using Supabase</li>
    <li>Supervior Interface for managing multiple ongoing processes</li>
    <li>Mobile-first task and document app for employees</li>
  </ul>
aboutProject:
  leftCol: >
    <p>Offboard flow was designed to offer a solution to improve security, save equipment cost and limit equipment loss further.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built using modern full-stack technologies (Node.js, Deno, Svelte)</li>
      <li>Implemented secure authentication and session flows</li>
    </ul>
  rightCol: >
    <p>We engineered a high-performance architecture with async data exchanges and robust API handling to deliver smooth user experiences.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct Supabase connection for productivity and flexibility</li>
      <li>Isolated PII for better privacy and compliance</li>
      <li>Automated processes using n8n.io</li>
      <li>Future path for Mobile App support</li>
    </ul>
whatWeDid:
  leftCol: >
    <p>With further integrations in mind, we built a scalable and flexible base.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deployed using European CDN + serverless infrastructure </li>
      <li>Set up an automated build, test, deployment based on GitHub</li>
    </ul>
  rightCol: >
    <p>The projected savings are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HR workload of 5000 hours per year</li>
      <li>Reduction in cost of extended equipment leasing costs</li>
      <li>Mitigation of the impact of 3-5 security incidents</li>
    </ul>
