introduction: >
  <p>During my year-long assignment at Meta Reality Labs, I contributed to multiple avatar systems across the spectrum from consumer social media to cutting-edge VR research. My work spanned stylized avatar tools for Instagram, 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines, and advanced visualization systems for avatar research.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stylized Avatar tools for Instagram with clothing customization</li>
    <li>3D Gaussian Splatting avatar systems in Python and Unity for VR</li>
    <li>Research visualization tools with parametric avatar manipulation</li>
    <li>Multi-camera sensor fusion pipelines for avatar generation</li>
  </ul>
aboutProject:
